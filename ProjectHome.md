# Overview #
Open source feature modeling tool with support for interactive product configuration.

Fully browser based, provides a rich user interface allowing for visual design of feature models through an SVG/javascript based implementation.

Currently uses Microsoft's Z3 SMT solver for validating and providing feedback to users. A future release will provide support for using an open-source SMT engine in order to keep the tool free for users wishing to use it for commercial purposes.
